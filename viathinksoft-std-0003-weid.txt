VTS/WF STD. 3          Wehowski Identifier (WEID)       3 September 2024


1  Introduction

   An Object Identifier (OID) is an extensively used identification
   mechanism jointly developed by ITU-T and ISO/IEC for naming any type
   of object, concept, or "thing" with a globally unambiguous name.
   (More information about OIDs can be found at www.oid-info.com).

   To get an OID in accordance with Recommendation ITU-T X.600 assigned,
   you need to find a Registration Authority that assigns you an OID.
   You can obtain an OID as WEID and manage your own arc, e.g. by:

   - IANA Private Enterprise Numbers (PEN)
   - Free OID by ViaThinkSoft
   - "Public" OID by Frdlweb

   There are three well-known notations for OIDs:

      Dot notation:      2.999
      ASN.1 notation:    {joint-iso-itu-t(2) example(999)}
      OID-IRI notation:  /Joint-ISO-ITU-T/Example

   WEID (WEhowski IDentifier) is another notation for OIDs, developed by
   Till Wehowski and Daniel Marschall:

      WEID notation:     weid:root:2-RR-2

   In the initial version of the WEID specification of 2011, only OIDs
   below the WEID root arc 1.3.6.1.4.1.37553.8 could be used. In a later
   definition by Daniel Marschall, any existing OID can be written in
   WEID notation, by defining sub-namespaces.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2  URN Namespace

   Uniform Resource Name (URN) [RFC2141] Namespace Identifiers (NIDs)
   for use by WEID are being specified in this document.

   The registry of sub-namespaces (URN prefixes) has currently the
   following entries:

2.1  Namespace "weid:" for "Class C" WEIDs

   Root OID is 1.3.6.1.4.1.37553.8

   Example: OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.37553.8.32488192274 can be written as
   weid:EXAMPLE-3 (3 is the check digit)

   The registration of WEID Alphanumeric OIDs beneath this arc is
   managed by Webfan.de in order of FRDLWEB. You can assign a Private
   WEID by Frdlweb here:
   https://registry.frdl.de/?goto=com.frdlweb.freeweid

2.2  Sub-Namespace "weid:pen:" for "Class B" WEIDs

   Root OID is 1.3.6.1.4.1

   Example: OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.37476.9999 can be written as weid:pen:SX0-
   7PR-6 (6 is the check digit)

   The registration of Private Enterprise Numbers (PEN) is managed by
   IANA. You can register a PEN here:
   https://pen.iana.org/pen/PenApplication.page

2.3  Sub-Namespace "weid:root:" for "Class A" WEIDs

   Root OID is the OID tree root

   Example: OID 2.999 can be written as weid:root:2-RR-2 (2 is the check
   digit)

   More sub-namespaces can be added to this registry in the future. The
   sub-namespaces must be defined by the WEID consortium (ViaThinkSoft
   and WebFan) in a Specification Change.

3  Construction of a WEID

   The construction of a WEID is demonstrated with the example OID
   2.999:

   (1) The numeric arcs (e.g. 2 and 999) are converted from base 10 to
       base 36, so the arcs become 2 and RR.

   (2) The arcs are separated by a hyphen -, so we have now 2-RR.

   (3) Now, an appropriate namespace (and sub-namespace if applicable)
       will be added. In our case, a fitting (sub-)namespace is
       weid:root:, so we now have weid:root:2-RR

   (4) In the end, a Luhn-based check digit (called WeLuhn) is added. If
       the WEID contains at least one arc, then the check digit is
       preceded by a hyphen.

   The WeLuhn algorithm works this way:

   (4.1) First, we take the OID in dot notation (e.g. 2.999)

   (4.2) The arcs will be converted from base 10 to base 36, so we have
         2-RR. Padding zeros must not be present and need to be
         stripped.

   (4.3) The hyphens are removed, so we now have 2RR.

   (4.4) "A" will be replaced with 10, "B" will be replaced with 11,
         etc., so we now have 22727.

   This number is the payload for the normal Luhn algorithm which works
   as follows:

   (4.5) Start from the rightmost digit. Moving left, double the value
         of every second digit (including the rightmost digit).

   (4.6) Sum the digits of the resulting value in each position.

   (4.7) Sum the resulting values from all positions, s.

   (4.8) The check digit is calculated by ((10-s mod 10) mod 10). In our
         case, the Luhn checksum is 2.

   (5) Our final WEID notation for OID 2.999 is weid:root:2-RR-2.

4  Specification Changes

4.1  Spec Change 8: Recommendations for WEID notation

   When choosing a (sub-)namespace, it is recommended to choose a sub-
   namespace that is closest to the OID you want to describe, producing
   the shortest WEID therefore. For example, weid:pen:SX0-7PR-6 should
   be chosen rather than weid:root:1-3-6-1-4-1-SX0-7PR-6

   The arcs in a WEID should be written in upper-case, but lowercase can
   be interpreted, too.

   The URN namespace (weid:, weid:pen:, weid:root:) is case insensitive,
   but it is recommended to write it in lowercase.

VTS/WF STD. 3          Wehowski Identifier (WEID)       3 September 2024


   Padding with 0 characters is valid (e.g. weid:000EXAMPLE-3), but not
   recommended. The paddings do not count toward the WeLuhn check digit.

4.2  Spec Change 9: Recommendations for WEID notation

   In Spec Change 9 (8 March 2022), an alternative syntax of WEIDs is
   defined. This alternative syntax replaces the checksum with a
   wildcard in the form of a question mark symbol, for example,
   weid:root:2-RR-? instead of weid:root:2-RR-2. One useful scenario can
   be the documentation of incomplete/template WEIDs. Another usage is
   converters (like our online converter) which can help you replace the
   wildcard with the correct checksum.

4.3  Spec Change 10: Domain-WEID ("Class D" WEID)

   Spec Change 10 (7 August 2023) allows domain names to be used as WEID
   sub-namespace.

   All WEID sub-namespaces containing at least one dot (.) are treated
   as domain names.

   The notation weid:example.com:ABC-DEF-? is equal to weid:9-DNS-COM-
   EXAMPLE-ABC-DEF-?.

   The resulting WEID is called Domain-WEID or "Class D" WEID.

   Note that the check digit is equal for both notations since it is
   based on the resulting OID.

   TLD-Only domains are not allowed for the purpose of forming a Domain-
   WEID.

   A Domain-WEID can be converted to Class A/B/C WEID, but the reverse
   conversion is ambiguous ("where does the domain name end and where
   does the identifier part start?")

4.4  Spec Change 11: Proprietary Namespaces

   Spec Change 11 (7 August 2023) allows custom / vendor-specific WEID
   sub-namespaces.

   Such namespaces must begin with x-, for example: weid:x-contoso:ABC-
   DEF-? could be a WEID defined by Contoso Ltd.

   As usual for WEID, the namespace is case insensitive.

VTS/WF STD. 3          Wehowski Identifier (WEID)       3 September 2024


   To avoid confusion with Spec Change 10 Domain-WEID, the sub-namespace
   must not contain a dot (.).

   The vendor has complete control over the namespace and can define the
   behavior. However, it is recommended to make use of Base36 and the
   weLuhn check digit.

   Since the vendor specifies the namespace, it is up to the vendor if
   they allow the mapping of their WEID-Namespace to the OID-Tree. In
   comparison to class A/B/C/D WEID which are 100% OID compatible,
   custom WEID might not be OID-compatible at all.

   Currently, the following custom namespaces are known:

   (1) weid:x-frdl:[Base36_NS]-[SubNS]:[Base36_ID]-[CheckDigit] to be
       defined/implemented by Frdlweb.

   If you know more namespaces, or if you are the author of a custom
   namespace, please let us know.

5  Additional notes

   Any WEID (except for Custom WEID as defined in Spec Change 11) can be
   represented by an OID and vice-versa. Therefore, a WEID has all
   attributes of an OID (e.g. it can be used to generate a Version 5
   SHA1 name-based UUID with the Namespace UUID 6ba7b812-9dad-11d1-80b4-
   00c04fd430c8 according to IETF RFC-4122).

   Please note that some clients handling OIDs cannot handle arcs that
   have a specific size. Implementers of WEID strongly encourage
   allowing arbitrary length arcs (i.e. implementing BigInteger rather
   than 32-bit integers).

   At www.weid.info you can find more information and announcements of
   changes.

   The current version of the specification is 11, which is identified
   with the OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.37553.8.1.8.1.6.1.11 (weid:1-8-1-6-1-B-7).
