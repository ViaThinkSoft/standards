VTS/WF STD. 10        Illegal OID Definition File      11 September 2024


1  Introduction

   This document describes a file format that describes detection of
   file formats, e.g. by filename extension.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2  File Structure / Example

   [1.3.6.1.4.1.37476.3.1.5.2]

   -- Standard OID Illegality Rule Definition File
   -- by Daniel Marschall and Olivier Dubuisson
   -- Revision: 7 July 2024

   -- SYNTAX:
   -- -- comment    : comments are also allowed after a rule definition
   -- 2.999.(11-).0 : the arc values 11 and below are illegal
   -- 2.999.(11+).0 : the arc values 11 and above are illegal
   -- 2.999.(1-5).0 : the arc values 1 to 5 are illegal
   -- 2.999.(!3).0  : only arc 3 is valid, all others are invalid
   --                 (added in version 2)
   -- 2.999.*       : * is equal to (0+). Usually used for leaf OIDs

   0.(10+)                -- itu, currently max 9
   0.4.(1+)               -- 0.4.0 is the only identified organization
   1.1.3.*                -- Reserved for ISO/IEC 9834-3
   1.2.6                  -- was 1.3.6 meant?
   1.2.826.1004           -- The correct OID is 1.2.826.0.1004

3  Ideas for Future Developments ("Format 3.0")

   - JSON Format

   - Better notation for ranges, with multiple components.

   - Differentiate between "illegal" (must not exist) and "must-not-
   create" (may exist, but must not create).

   - Machine-readable description instead of a comment.

   - Include/Exclude lines. You start from top to bottom and

   include/exclude stuff, and at the end you have an answer if the OID
   is illegal.

   - For frozen OIDs, we must allow that a single arc is frozen (non-
   existing OIDs are illegal), but the existing OIDs may create
   children.

4  Security Considerations

   None

5  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA Considerations.
