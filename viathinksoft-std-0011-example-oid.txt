1  Introduction

   This document describes an OID that can be used as an example for
   OIDs.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2  Current Status

   The OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.37476.9999 is deprecated in favor of OID 2.999
   which was officially allocated by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 6 at its June 2011
   meeting and by ITU-T SG 17 at its September 2011 meeting. Please use
   this OID instead!

3  Description Of 18 April 2011

   ViaThinkSoft releases following arc for public-domain usage:

   Dot notation 1.3.6.1.4.1.37476.9999

   ASN.1 notation {iso(1) identified-organizatin(3) dod(6) internet(1)
   private(4) enterprise(1) 37476 example(9999)}

   OID-IRI notation /ISO/Identified-Organization/6/1/4/1/37476/Example

   This is a free useable arc for EVERYONE with the purpose of
   documenting resp. implementing examples of object identifiers. You
   can use this OID as well as every subsequent OID without any
   registration or permission.

   Please note that due to the nature of this OID, the OID itself as
   well as all of its children DON'T describe any real object. OIDs
   inside this arc are NOT assigned to anybody and therefore the numbers
   are not uniquely identifying an object and there is no ownership
   accepted for anybody.

   This arc can be used e.g. if you want to document an ASN.1 module
   parser and want to include an example module with "any" OID in the
   documentation. You can also use this arc if you are publishing an
   Open Source project with OID constants and a demo project which
   contains unspecified OIDs. This example OID and all its children give
   you the chance to write and publish such demo projects resp.

   documentations with examples without using an OID illegally.

   Note: You can also consider using a random generated UUID OID under
   the arc {joint-iso-itu-t(2) uuid(25)}, but in this case you must be
   sure that your implementation is capable with parsing 128-bit number-
   identifiers!

   This is a LEAF OID - this means that no child OIDs may be added to
   the repository.

   Formal, the registration authority of this arc is Daniel Marschall,
   ViaThinkSoft, but de facto this arc is not controlled by anyone and
   can be considered as public domain.

   This example OID has the same purpose as example.com has for examples
   of web pages.
