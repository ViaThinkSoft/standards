VTS/WF STD. 1               VTS/WF Standards            4 September 2024


1  Introduction

   This document describes how the standards for ViaThinkSoft and Webfan
   are defined, written, and published.

   The current standards are published here: 
   https://github.com/ViaThinkSoft/standards

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2  General Rules

   Each document receives a sequential number.

   Documents can be changed (unless RFCs).  If the change is minor
   (like, fixing a typo), the revision date does not need to be changed.

   Each document can be identified with the URN
   "urn:viathinksoft.de:std:<nnnn>:<yyyy-mm-dd>".  This URN can be
   extended by components (delimited with colon), e.g. to get an URN for
   a XML schema identifier.

2  Tool Chain

   The documents should be written in Nroff Internet Draft Editor by 3xA
   Security. It can be downloaded here:
   https://aaa-sec.com/nroffedit/
   https://misc.daniel-marschall.de/patches/nroffedit/ ("year 2020"
   patch)

3  General Structure

   The overall structure, style, and look-and-feel of a
   ViaThinkSoft/Webfan standard should be similar to the IETF Internet
   Drafts.  Note that the documentation and style of some standards are
   not yet done, and hence these standards look a bit "rough" and a lot
   of IETF rules are currently broken.

   A key difference between an IETF Internet Draft and a VTS/WF Standard
   is the first page and the header and footer lines of the pages.
